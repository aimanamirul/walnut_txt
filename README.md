## Developer Notes

A light project from me, aiming to familiarize and get used to NextJS.

It is a notes/memoir/diary app and will be in continous development as new ideas pop up. The rudimentary concept (CRUD of the notes) however is completed to function.

Primarily based on Fireship's tutorial on NextJS 13.

## General Notes Below

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
